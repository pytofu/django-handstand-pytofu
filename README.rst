Shamelessly cloned from 

django-handstand-audreyr
========================

My personal mashup of:

* Base template using Twitter Bootstrap for CSS styling
* A core module with a BaseModel that provides created/modified times
* Custom simple profiles app
* Profile edit form, rendered with Bootstrap styles
* Registration via django-social-auth (Twitter & Facebook)
* Lazy profile shortcut that gives you a request.my_profile context variable
* django-debug-toolbar
* django-startcbv, to create quick working prototypes of whatever apps I need
* django-extensions, to give me shell_plus and whatever else comes with it

This is likely to be unstable, since it's meant for my own personal use.  Beware, parts of it could even be dangerous ;)
